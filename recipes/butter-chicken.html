   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This classic recipe features a delicious blend of flavors: sweet, salty, and savory. The chicken is marinated in a rich, flavorful butter sauce, and then slowly cooked on the stove until golden brown. The result is a flavorful, satisfying meal.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
       <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
       <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
       <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
       <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt and pepper. </li>
    <li>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
   </ol>

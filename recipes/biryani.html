   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
       <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
       <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
       <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
       <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
       <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
       <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
    <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
    <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
   </ol>
